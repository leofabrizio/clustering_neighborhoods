# Clustering Neighborhoods

## Description

### This project, entirely written in Python, has been completed as a requirement for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. In summary, the project attempted to find an optimal location for a new Japanese restaurant in London. To do so, I mostly worked on density data and, using a combination of basic statistics and machine learning (i.e. cluster analysis), I identified and selected neighborhoods with very few restaurants, no japanese restaurants and close to the city center. For a detailed description of the project and its results please refer to the file **report.pdf** or to the powerpoint file **coursera_final_project.pptx**. If you want to have a look at the Python code refer to the file **The_Battle_of_Neighborhoods_week2_git.ipynb**.
